G-Function
==========

This test case uses the G-Function.

.. math::
    F = \Pi_{i=1}^d \frac{\lvert 4x_i - 2\rvert + a_i}{1 + a_i}

The dimension of the output is 1.

Depending on the coefficient :math:`a_i`, their is an impact on the impact on
the output. The more the coefficient is for a parameter, the less the parameter
is important.

The parameters of the analysis are to be configured within
`settings.json`.
