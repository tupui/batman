Function 3D
===========

This test case uses the Ishigami function.

F = np.sin(X1)+7*np.sin(X2)**2+0.1*(X3**4)*np.sin(X1)

The dimension of the output is 1D with `function.py` and 2D with `function2F.py`.

This tast case shows the use of the `-u` option which do a statistical analysis
on the function outputs. The parameters of the analysis are to be configured within
`script/settings_template.py`.
