History
-------

This project was started in 2007 at CERFACS under the name JPOD by Thierry
Braconnier and Marc Ferrier-supervised by Jean-François Boussuge. It has been
successfully tested and validated on industrial configurations during the
European SimSAC and ALEF (FP7) projects. It has been forgotten untill 2015 when
Romain Dupuis-supervised by Marc Montagnac and Jean-Christophe Jouhaud-started
using it. After that in 2016, Uncertainty Quantification capabilities were
added by Pamphile Roy leading to a new name: BATMAN. On 2017 we released the
code on GitLab as open-source.
