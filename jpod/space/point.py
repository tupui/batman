"""
A simple class of points in space.

A point is a tuple of coordinates, thus this class derives from the tuple class.
A point can be created either from integer or float coordinates, they are stored internally as float values.
Two points can be compared with the usual `==` or `!=`, it can be approximative in the sense that two close points can be equals. The comparison is done by computing the distance of the points and checking it against a predefined threshold.
